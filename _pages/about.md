Embedded Systems Engineer Currently pursuing Masters in Embedded Systems Design from [Hochschule Bremerhaven](https://hs-bremerhaven.de). I am currently doing my master Thesis at [AVL Software and Functions](https://www.avl-functions.com) where im optimizing Traffic Sign Detection models for Edge Devices.

I have valuable working experience in the research and development of software architecture, design and testing of products. Comprehensive knowledge in the field of Embedded Systems and Computer Programming.

In my freetime I like to read books, and travel the universe in my spaceship 'Heart of Gold'.
